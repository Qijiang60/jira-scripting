# Jira script examples

The purpose of this project is to serve as documentation for writing scripts that can be run using the free Script Runner add-on for Jira.

## How can I develop the scripts?
Just run `gradlew` from the command line. This will download all libraries required for creating the scripts and will also generate the IntelliJ IDEA project which you can open by double clicking on the `ipr` file.
